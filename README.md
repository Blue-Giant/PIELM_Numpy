### Ideas
This work exploited the technique of shifting the input data in narrow-range into large-range, then fed the transformed data into the DNN pipline.

### Abstract: 
Obtaining the solutions of partial differential equations based on various machine learning methods hasdrawn more and more attention in the fields of scientific computation and engineering applications. In thiswork, we first propose a coupled Extreme Learning Machine (called CELM) method incorporated with thephysical laws to solve a class of fourth-order biharmonic equations by reformulating it into two well-posedPoisson problems. In addition, some activation functions including tangent, gauss, sine, and trigonometric(sin+cos) functions are introduced to assess our CELM method. Notably, the sine and trigonometric functions demonstrate a remarkable ability to effectively minimize the approximation error of the CELM model.In the end, several numerical experiments are performed to study the initializing approaches for both theweights and biases of the hidden units in our CELM model and explore the required number of hiddenunits. Numerical results show the proposed CELM algorithm is high-precision and efficient to address thebiharmonic equation in both regular and irregular domains
